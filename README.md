## Overview
In this repository, I'll introduce a currency converter app created by the author. The app allows users to convert currencies and runs continuously until the user chooses to exit. It presents a menu of exchange options, prompts the user to select one, and accepts the desired amount to convert. The app then performs the conversion and displays the result. The author plans to enhance the app by incorporating real-time exchange rate data from the internet in future iterations, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions.
